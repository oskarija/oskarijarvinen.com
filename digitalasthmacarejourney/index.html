                Our assignment was to imagine how asthma care could be enhanced
                (digitally or otherwise). Our client, a private healthcare
                provider, cannot be named due to non-disclosure agreements.<br />
                <br />
                In a short 2-week project, our 4-person team carried out trend
                research, workshops, created user personas, and interviewed
                healthcare professionals.<br />
                <br />
                Our discoveries highlighted the significance of personalized
                services in enhancing patient experiences during challenging
                moments such as the onset of illness, and showcased the
                potential of new technologies for individualized care.

              <p class="projectdescription">
                At the start of the project, it became apparent that the journey
                as asthma patient is similar to almost any chronic illness
                journey. With two of our team members having firsthand
                experience with chronic conditions, we decided to leverage their
                knowledge throughout the project.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>Trend and Healthcare Landscape Workshop</h3>
              <p>
                Our initial step involved conducting a workshop within our team
                to gain insight into the broader healthcare landscape in Finland
                and any factors that might influence our project and the
                experiences of asthma patients.
              </p>
              <p>
                This workshop was structured around the
                <span class="bold">PESTEL</span>
                (or PESTLE) model. We were able to identify possible factors and
                megatrends that could influence our project as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Worsening public health - the increasing number of asthma
                  cases in Finland.
                </li>
                <li>Climate change.</li>
                <li>
                  The high amount of indoor air quality issues in Finland and
                  its potential impact on the number of asthma cases.
                </li>
                <li>The rapid aging of the population in Finland.</li>
                <li>Shortage of healthcare workers</li>

              <h3>Service Path Workshop</h3>
              <p class="">
                Following this, we held another workshop to map out the service
                pathway. Our objective was to comprehensively understand the
                diverse stages that patients navigate during their illness
                journey.what emotions did you experience, and what would you
                have wished for during different phases of your illness
              </p>
              <p class="">
                Using our experience in chronic illnesses, we tried to address
                the following question:
                <span class="italic"
                  >what emotions did you experience, and what would you have
                  wished for during different phases of your illness</span
                >*?
              </p>
              <p>
                This process yielded seven distinct phases: initial symptoms,
                independent information-seeking, seeking healthcare services,
                diagnosis, familiarizing with self-care, monitoring treatment,
                and adapting to life changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We identified recurring pain points in all stages of the service
                path as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="bold">Information overload</span> – Patients were
                  presented with a lot of information, making it difficult to
                  find what was relevant to them.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span class="bold">Uncertainty and worry</span> – Especially
                  before seeking treatment and during diagnosis.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Specific pain points for each stage of the service path:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Before treatment – Hesitance to seek treatment.</li>
                <li>During diagnosis – Difficulty in adjusting to the new.</li>
                <li>After diagnosis – Need for emotional support</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Findings from the workshop can be summarized as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li class="bold">
                  The need for support varies individually throughout the entire
                  pathway.
                </li>
                <li class="bold">
                  Patients require information throughout the care journey, but
                  the same information is not crucial for everyone in the same
                  situations.
                </li>

                  The service provides Matti with information on how asthma
                  works and how to quit smoking.

                  Gamified features and task-reward mechanisms (tailored to
                  Matti's needs) offer a sense of achievement and motivation.

                  After diagnosis, the application opens a care pathway, taking
                  into account Maija's active self-care.

                  Later, due to irregular measurement results, the service
                  offers Maija information on managing the asthma during
                  pregnancy.
