                Our assignment was to create a digital asthma care concept for a
                private healthcare provider (client cannot be named due to
                non-disclosure agreements).<br />
                <br />
                In a short 2-week project, our 4-person team carried out trend
                research, workshops, created user personas, and interviewed
                healthcare professionals.<br />
                <br />
                Our discoveries highlighted the significance of personalized

                moments such as the onset of illness, and showcased the

                At the start of the project, it became apparent that the journey
                as asthma patient is similar to almost any chronic illness
                journey. With two of our team members having firsthand
                experience with chronic conditions, we decided to leverage their
                knowledge throughout the project.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>Workshop 1</h3>
              <p>
                Our initial step involved conducting a workshop within our team
                to gain insight into the broader healthcare landscape in Finland
                and any factors that might influence our project and the
                experiences of asthma patients.
              </p>
              <p>
                This workshop was structured around the PESTEL (or PESTLE)
                model. We were able to identify possible factors and megatrends
                that could influence our project as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Worsening public health - the increasing number of asthma
                  cases in Finland.
                </li>
                <li>Climate change.</li>
                <li>
                  The high amount of indoor air quality issues in Finland and
                  its potential impact on the number of asthma cases.
                </li>
                <li>The rapid aging of the population in Finland.</li>
                <li>Shortage of healthcare workers</li>

              <h3>Workshop 2</h3>
              <p class="">
                Following this, we held another workshop to map out the service
                pathway. Our objective was to comprehensively understand the
                diverse stages that patients navigate during their illness
                journey.what emotions did you experience, and what would you
                have wished for during different phases of your illness
              </p>
              <p class="">
                Using our experience in chronic illnesses, we tried to address
                the following question:
                <span class="italic"
                  >what emotions did you experience, and what would you have
                  wished for during different phases of your illness</span
                >*?
              </p>
              <p>
                This process yielded seven distinct phases: initial symptoms,
                independent information-seeking, seeking healthcare services,
                diagnosis, familiarizing with self-care, monitoring treatment,
                and adapting to life changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We identified recurring pain points in all stages of the service
                path as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="bold">Information overload</span> – Patients were
                  presented with a lot of information, making it difficult to
                  find what was relevant to them.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span class="bold">Uncertainty and worry</span> – Especially
                  before seeking treatment and during diagnosis.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Specific pain points for each stage of the service path:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Before treatment – Hesitance to seek treatment.</li>
                <li>During diagnosis – Difficulty in adjusting to the new.</li>
                <li>After diagnosis – Need for emotional support</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Findings from the workshop can be summarized as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The need for support varies individually throughout the entire
                  pathway.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Patients require information throughout the care journey, but
                  the same information is not crucial for everyone in the same
                  situations. Information needs are individual.
                </li>

              <p class="projectdescription">
                In our effort to enhance user experience, we implemented the
                following improvements:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We narrowed down potential elements in the folder structure to
                  either <span class="bold"> canvases</span> or
                  <span class="bold"> folders.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  We opted not to use the "Team" or "Project" prefix for folders
                  aiming to diminish the user's need to figure out a intended
                  usage for each.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A new folder is simply titled "Untitled" providing flexibility
                  for users to name it depending on their own needs or
                  preferences.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Folders created by the user are visible in the
                  <span class="bold"> "Your folders" </span>view.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Folders shared with the user are visible in the
                  <span class="bold"> "Shared to you"</span> view.

              <h3>Streamlined Flow for Creating a New Canvas</h3>
              <p class="projectdescription">
                In our pursuit of optimizing the user experience we incorporated
                the following enhancements:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Users have the ability to create a new canvas or folder with
                  just one click.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any newly created canvas by the user is automatically
                  transferred to the drafts folder.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="projectdescription">
                These modifications address three distinct user scenarios:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Users who prefer to begin filling the canvas right away and
                  may choose to relocate it later.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Users who want to rename their canvas immediately after
                  creation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Users who need to relocate the canvas file right after its
                  creation.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ol>
              <h3>Tabs Feature for Canvas View</h3>
              <p class="projectdescription">
                Following thorough benchmarking, we added a neat feature to our
                canvas view – tabs. This allows users to easily switch between
                different canvas versions within a single view. This proves
                particularly beneficial for different types of users – from
                those who prefer creating entirely new canvases for each project
                to users who stick to one canvas and utilize tabs to explore and
                develop multiple ideas. The tab windows feature not only
                streamlines the user interface but also caters to varied
                workflows.
              </p>
              <p class="projectdescription">
                The client was particularly keen on this feature, expressing a
                desire to address a gap in existing tools where the ability to
                compare different canvas versions was noticeably lacking.

              <p class="projectdescription">
                Throughout the prototyping phase, we not only validated our
                initial design decisions but also gathered insights that played
                a key role in refining and shaping our design choices. These
                insights also provided direction for the next steps to the
                client.
              </p>
              <p class="projectdescription">
                The user testing was carried out with a fairly low-fidelity
                approach, involving rapid modification of features and
                subsequent testing to validate the effectiveness of our design
                decisions in a iterative manner. The group of people involved in
                testing included anyone we could find quickly, such as
                colleagues, people in the office corridor, or even spouses.

              <h3>Insights</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We discovered (and validated our assumptions) that different
                  users navigate using different sections of the user interface.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some users found dragging and dropping canvases or folders (to
                  change their location) to be an intuitive and effective way of
                  interacting with the interface.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For some users, using mouse right-click function to interact
                  with various elements of the interface, such as opening a
                  dropdown window, could be more intuitive.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Next Steps</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The immediate focus should be on developing a Minimum Viable
                  Product (MVP).
                </li>
                <li>
                  It's crucial not to extend design work too far without
                  technical implementation. Proper implementation would provide
                  valuable user data in a real-world environment and technical
                  constraints could influence design decisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Further testing with the user groups (course instructors &
                  students) would be essential.
