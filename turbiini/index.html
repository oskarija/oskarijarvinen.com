                  The US-based Business Model Canvas tool our client had been
                  using couldn't be used for teaching purposes in Finland due to
                  legal (GDPR) limitations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A similar tool that could be used in education in their
                  organisation doesn't exist.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The tool our client had been using has usability issues they
                  felt like shouldn't exist.

              <h3>Recognizing Usability Issues</h3>
              <p class="projectdescription">
                Recognizing usability issues with the client's current tool, we
                opted to delve directly into understanding their needs. By
                swiftly addressing these concerns in an initial prototype, we
                could subsequently begin testing with other potential users of
                the product.
              </p>
              <p class="projectdescription">
                Usability challenges faced by the client in using the existing
                tool that we recognized were:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p class="bold">Information architecture is confusing</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In which folder, project, or team does each canvas belong?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      What do teams and projects mean? In other words, the
                      naming was confusing.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p class="bold">
                    The flow for creating a new file is too complicated.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The user cannot start to fill out the canvas before naming
                      it and choosing its location.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p class="bold">File management is difficult.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      What if the user wants to change the location of the
                      canvas after starting to work on it?
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p class="bold">
                    The service does not provide an easy way to create and
                    review multiple versions of a canvas.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      One main benefit of using a business model canvas
                      (especially for a course instructor) is to iterate and to
                      compare different versions over time.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
              </ul>
              <h3>Understanding the User</h3>
              <p>
                Before creating the first prototype we had to map the tool's
                possible user base:
                <!-- #turbiiniuserbase can be used here -->
                <ul id="turbiiniuserbase">
                    <li>Business course instructors</li>
                    <li>Individuals actively participating in the operations of Turbiini</li>
                    <li>Students functioning as entrepreneurs.</li>
                </ul>  
              </p>
              <p>
                This understanding formed the foundation for our design
                approach, enabling us to conceptualize a tool that addresses the
                unique requirements of each user group. This would lead to
                design solutions that take every group into consideration.

              <h3>Simplifying the Information Architecture</h3>
              <p class="projectdescription">
                In our effort to enhance user experience, we implemented the following improvements:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>We narrowed down potential elements in the folder structure to either <span class="bold"> canvases</span> or <span class="bold"> folders.</span></li>
                <li>We opted not to use the "Team" or "Project" prefix for folders aiming to diminish the user's need to figure out a intended usage for each.</li>
                <li>A new folder is simply titled "Untitled" providing flexibility for users to name it depending on their own needs or preferences.</li>
                <li>Folders created by the user are visible in the <span class="bold"> "Your folders" </span>view.</li>
                <li>Folders shared with the user are visible in the <span class="bold"> "Shared to you"</span> view.</li>
                <br>
              </ul>
              <div class="verspacer"></div>
              <h3>Streamlined Flow for Creating a New Canvas</h3>
              <p class="projectdescription">In our pursuit of optimizing the user experience we incorporated the following enhancements:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Users have the ability to create a new canvas or folder with just one click.</li>
                <li>Any newly created canvas by the user is automatically transferred to the drafts folder.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="projectdescription">
                These modifications address three distinct user scenarios:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Users who prefer to begin filling the canvas right away and may choose to relocate it later.</li>
                <li>Users who want to rename their canvas immediately after creation.</li>
                <li>Users who need to relocate the canvas file right after its creation.</li>
                <br>
              </ol>
              <h3>Tab Windows for Canvas View</h3>
